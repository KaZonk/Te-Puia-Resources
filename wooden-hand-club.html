                    <p class="column-text">Before Europeans and European weapons arrived in Aotearoa, 
                        Māori warfare mainly involved hand-to-hand combat
                        . Warriors used many different hand weapons, including taiaha (fighting staffs)
                        , pouwhenua (pointed staffs), tewhatewha (axe-like staffs), tao (short spears), huata (long spears) and patu (clubs)
                        . The long weapons were carried, and the small clubs were often tucked into a belt
                        . Special weapons were sometimes given names and passed down through generations.</p>

                    <p class="column-text">Wars could be fought over land and resources, but also as utu (revenge) or to increase mana (prestige)
                        . There were many traditions and rules to be followed during battles in earlier times
                        . War parties (taua) could range in size from a small group to a few hundred people
                        . Most battles took place in the summer months after the harvesting of crops was completed
                        . The element of surprise was important, so raids often happened at dawn.
                        Though there were deaths and injuries as a result of skirmishes in pre-European times
                        , the numbers were very small in comparison to the slaughter that occurred when muskets became available.</p>
